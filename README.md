## Introduction

Text classification involves assigning predefined categories to text data. Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model such as BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT can significantly improve classification performance on specific tasks. This repository demonstrates the process using the Transformers library by Hugging Face.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.8.1 or higher
- Transformers library by Hugging Face

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-classification-finetune.git
    cd text-classification-finetune
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset

Prepare your custom dataset for text classification. The dataset should be in CSV format with columns `text` and `label`. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory:

```
data/
  train.csv
  val.csv
```

Ensure your CSV files follow this structure:

```csv
text,label
"This is a sample text",0
"Another example text",1
...
```

## Fine-Tuning

To fine-tune the text classification model on your dataset, execute the following command:

```bash
python fine_tune.py --train_file data/train.csv --val_file data/val.csv --model_name bert-base-uncased --output_dir models/text-classifier
```

### Fine-Tuning Parameters

- `--train_file`: Path to the training dataset CSV file.
- `--val_file`: Path to the validation dataset CSV file.
- `--model_name`: Name of the pre-trained model to use (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`).
- `--output_dir`: Directory where the fine-tuned model will be saved.

Additional training parameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs can be customized in the `fine_tune.py` script.

## Evaluation

After fine-tuning, evaluate the model to ensure it meets the desired performance metrics. Run the evaluation script as follows:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_dir models/text-classifier --test_file data/val.csv
```

This script will generate performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results

The results of the fine-tuning process, including training and evaluation metrics, will be saved in the `results/` directory. Key metrics to consider are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Usage

To use the fine-tuned text classification model for inference, load it using the Transformers library:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
import torch

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("models/text-classifier")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("models/text-classifier")

input_text = "Your input text here"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
predicted_class = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1).item()

print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}")
```
